# eece-department-project-cad-algorithms
 
This repository consists of four homeworks associated with course "CAD Algorithms". This course is part of the undergraduate studies of University of Thessally - EECE Department located in Volos, Greece.

The four homeworks function properly as standalone projects but as a whole, constitute the development of a bigger project which started from assignment one and the creation of a TCL Shell, continued with homeworks 2 and 3, where new features were added to the shell and reached its final form in homework 4 were the last requested features were added. All these features are commands that implement CAD algorithms and are mostly related to Logical-Synthesis topic. 

#### Homework 1 overview: 

Implementation of a TCL shell in C language with the following features:

    1. Tab completion
    2. History
    3. Basic os commands like ls, less

#### Homework 2 overview:

Addition of the following cube notation operations as commands to the existing TCL shell from homework 1:
    
    1. Cube intersect
    2. Supercube
    3. Distance 
    4. Cube cover
    5. Sharp 
    6. Sharp between a cube and a function.
    7. OFF calculation.
    
 #### Homework 3 overview:
 
 Implementation of Static Timing Analysis by integrating the Longest Path Algorithm for a given graph as a command-feature into the shell. To achieve graphical illustration of the graph, a 3rd-party tool was used, named TCL graphiz.
 
 #### Homework 4 overview:
 
 Addition of the R_KERNELS (Recursive Kernels) and the Algebric Division algorithms as commands-feautures to the TCL Shell.
